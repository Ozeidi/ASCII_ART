## Background
This repo is inspired by the the recent [Coding Challenge by Danniel Shiffman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55iwMYv8tGI), where he  demonstrates a variety of techniques for translating the pixels of an image into text.
In my version of the challenge, I added a color blender, giving user more control over the color theme to be used for the rendering.
